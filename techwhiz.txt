The Fight against the impact of climate change
Majority of people(Especially Africa) lack understanding of their individual contributions to climate change, hindering effective collective action.
Why it matters: Collective climate action is crucial for mitigating the severe and irreversible impacts of climate change, ensuring a sustainable future for all.
GCGO: 13. Climate Change Action
The Problem

Climate change is one of the greatest crises of our time, driving extreme weather, threatening food security, and impacting global health. If temperatures rise by 1.5°C by 2030, the consequences could be catastrophic, including $100 billion in annual economic losses and 250,000 additional deaths yearly by 2050. However, solutions like solar-powered irrigation, climate apps, and resilient crops offer hope for a sustainable future.

chart illustrates the annual increase in methane (CH4) emissions from 1985 to 2024. It highlights that the highest methane emissions occurred between 2020 and 2025, with 2023 recording the peak level of 18 ppb, making it the year with the highest methane emissions globally.in 2024, methane decreased by 8 ppb

Our Findings #1

The graphs show the global average concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere over time. The concentration has been increasing steadily since 1980. This is due to human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels.

 The Global Carbon Budget
The global carbon budget is the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) that can be emitted into the atmosphere while still limiting global warming to a certain level. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has set a target of limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels to avoid the most severe impacts of climate change.
To achieve this target, the remaining carbon budget is rapidly diminishing.
As of 2023, the remaining carbon budget for a 50% chance of limiting warming to 1.5°C is estimated to be around 250 gigatons of CO2. This means that global emissions need to be drastically reduced in the coming years to stay within this budget.

This information emphasizes the urgency of the climate crisis and the need for immediate and significant action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
